Welcome to Cly's Open World! 
This is the first world opened to open collaboration in the primitier discord server. (Although I can only speak for an english speaker.) 

To play this level, download it and put it in this pc > documents > primitier > saves.
To upload it when you are done, make a commit and upload the level file again. 

Do's and Dont's:

 -Do describe what you worked on/what changes you made when you upload the world. 
 
 -Don't wait to upload the world once you stop playing. Dont upload more than once a day, but to avoid confusion and lost effort lets keep the file up to date for everyone. 
 
 -Don't explore massive swaths of land and then upload the save afterwards. This greatly and unnessicarilly increases the file size, and there is a limit of 80mb? 
 
 -Don't ruin the landscape recklessly and upload the save. 
 
 -Dont take from others without asking. Borrow at your own risk, make sure to put everything borrowed back before uploading. 
 
 -Don't save in the middle of nowhere. I highly reccomend saving at the spawn tree.
